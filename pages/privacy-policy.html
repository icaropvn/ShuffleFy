            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>ShuffleFy is an open-source application designed to allow Spotify users to shuffle the songs in their playlists in a customized way. ShuffleFy is based on the Spotify Public Web API, ensuring a secure and reliable integration with the service. Our commitment is to guarantee users' privacy and data security, fully respecting their confidentiality.</p>

            <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
            <p>When using ShuffleFy, we request permission to access the following data from your Spotify account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Username;</li>
                <li>Profile picture (if available);</li>
                <li>Public and private playlists (including their names and musical content).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is exclusively required for ShuffleFy to provide its core playlist shuffling functionality and to identify the user.</p>

            <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
            <p>The collected data is used only during the active user session to organize the playlists. ShuffleFy does not store, share, or save any user profile information from Spotify on servers or databases.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to third parties. All information accessed by ShuffleFy remains local and temporary, being discarded once the session ends.</p>

            <h2>5. Revoking Access</h2>
            <p>You can revoke ShuffleFy's access to your Spotify account at any time. To do this, visit your <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/apps/" target="_blank">Spotify apps page</a> and click <strong>"Remove Access"</strong> next to the ShuffleFy app. If you need help, check <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-on-other-apps/" target="_blank">Spotify’s official guide</a> for instructions.</p>
            <p>This will prevent ShuffleFy from accessing your data until you grant permission again.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Code Transparency</h2>
            <p>ShuffleFy is an open-source project, and its source code is publicly available. If you want to check how your data is used or contribute to the project, visit our <a href="https://github.com/icaropvn/ShuffleFy" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

            <h1>Can I restore my playlists to their original order?</h1>
            <p>No. ShuffleFy does not save your playlist’s original order before shuffling. So, make sure you really want to shuffle before confirming. If you’re unsure, we recommend creating a copy of your playlist before using the service.</p>

            <h1>Does ShuffleFy work with other streaming services?</h1>
            <p>Currently, ShuffleFy only works with Spotify. If there is enough demand, future versions may support other streaming platforms.</p>

            <h1>Will ShuffleFy steal my data?</h1>
            <p>We do not collect or store your personal information beyond what is necessary to authenticate your Spotify account and shuffle your playlists. For more details, check out our <a href="pages/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
